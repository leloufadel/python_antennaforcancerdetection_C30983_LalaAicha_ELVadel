# Scientific Computing with Python (Second Edition)

**Authors:** Claus Führer, Olivier Verdier, and Jan Erik Solem

## Overview

*Scientific Computing with Python* (Second Edition) is a comprehensive guide designed to help readers perform mathematical and scientific computing efficiently using Python 3.8. The book evolved from over 13 years of teaching Python in various academic and industrial contexts and is aimed at students, researchers, data scientists, and developers with a mathematical background.

Throughout the text, the authors emphasize the relationship between code and mathematical algorithms, encouraging readers to maintain that link for better readability and performance. The book recommends using the **Anaconda distribution** and the **Spyder editor** to create a stable environment for computational tasks.

## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1 — Getting Started

A brief "appetizer" tour of the main Python language elements, providing a quick start for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Four primary areas are covered:

- **Installation and Configuration** — Anaconda distribution, Spyder editor, IPython, and Jupyter notebooks.
- **Basic Data Types** — Numbers (integers, floats, complex), strings, variables, and lists.
- **Program Flow and Syntax** — Branching (`if`/`else`) and looping (`for`/`break`); mandatory indentation for code blocks.
- **Encapsulation and Modularity** — Defining functions with `def`/`return`, organizing code into scripts and modules, and using `import` to manage namespaces.

### Chapter 2 — Variables and Basic Types

A detailed introduction to foundational data types used in scientific computing. A type is defined as a set consisting of data content, its representation, and all possible operations.

- **Variables** — References to objects, created through assignments; combined operators like `+=` and `*=`.
- **Numeric Types:**
  - *Integers* (`int`) — Whole numbers.
  - *Floats* (`float`) — The most important type for scientific computing; covers internal representation and special values like `inf` and `nan`.
  - *Complex numbers* (`complex`) — Consist of real and imaginary parts (e.g., `3 + 5j`), accessed via `.real` and `.imag`.
- **Booleans** — `True` or `False`; logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and Boolean casting rules.
- **Strings** — Immutable text defined with single, double, or triple quotes; escape sequences, raw strings, `.format()`, and f-strings.

---

### Chapter 3 — Container Types

Explains how to group multiple Python objects into single structures. The primary difference between types lies in how elements are accessed and what operations can be performed.

- **Lists** — Most frequently used containers; support indexing, slicing, list comprehensions, and methods like `.append()`, `.sort()`, and `.pop()`. In-place operations modify lists directly and return `None`.
- **Tuples** — Immutable lists; useful for packing/unpacking variables and swapping values (e.g., `a, b = b, a`).
- **Dictionaries** — Unordered key-value pairs; created with `{}`; iterable over keys, values, or items.
- **Sets** — Containers for distinct objects; unordered and prohibit duplicates, mirroring mathematical sets.
- **Container Conversions** — Syntax for converting between types (e.g., `tuple()`, `list()`).
- **Type Checking** — The `isinstance` command is preferred, as it accounts for subclassing and inheritance.

### Chapter 4 — Linear Algebra – Arrays

Focuses on vectors and matrices, establishing the NumPy `ndarray` as the central tool for scientific computing.

- **Array Creation and Properties** — Created from lists or via `zeros`, `ones`, `full`, `diag`; characterized by `shape`, `dtype`, and `strides`.
- **Indexing and Slicing** — Accessing elements or subarrays in multiple dimensions; reshaping and transposing.
- **Operations** — Arithmetic is elementwise; the `dot` function or `@` operator handles matrix/vector multiplication.
- **SciPy's `linalg` Submodule** — Solving linear systems (LU decomposition) and least-squares problems (SVD).

---

### Chapter 5 — Advanced Array Concepts

Delves into sophisticated techniques to optimize efficiency and avoid common programming pitfalls.

- **Views vs. Copies** — Views share data with the original array; modifications to a view affect the source. Slicing, transposing, and reshaping typically create views.
- **Boolean Arrays and Indexing** — Arrays acting as masks to select or modify elements by condition; the `where` command for conditional logic.
- **Performance and Vectorization** — Replacing slow `for` loops with NumPy operations to leverage compiled FORTRAN/C code.
- **Broadcasting** — Arithmetic between arrays of different but compatible shapes, automatically extended to a common shape.
- **Sparse Matrices** — The `scipy.sparse` module with efficient formats like CSR and CSC for matrices with mostly zero entries.

---

### Chapter 6 — Plotting

Introduces the **Matplotlib** `pyplot` submodule as the primary visualization tool.

- **Basic Plotting** — Standard x/y plots, scatter plots, logarithmic plots (`loglog`), and histograms (`hist`).
- **Formatting and Customization** — Line properties, axis labels, and LaTeX for mathematical formulas in titles and annotations.
- **Advanced 2D Techniques** — `meshgrid` and `contour` for scalar functions; `imshow` for visualizing arrays as images.
- **Object-Oriented Plotting** — Working directly with axes and line objects for later modifications, annotations, and custom spines/tick labels.
- **3D and Animation** — 3D surface and scatter plots via `mplot3d`; movie creation using the `visvis` module.

---

### Chapter 7 — Functions

Explores functions as fundamental building blocks bridging programming and mathematical concepts.

- **Definitions and Calls** — Core syntax with `def` and `return`.
- **Arguments and Parameters** — Positional and keyword arguments, default values, and variable-length arguments via `*` and `**`.
- **Functions as Objects** — First-class objects: assignable, passable as arguments (e.g., to `fsolve` or `quad`), and usable in closures or partial applications.
- **Special Function Types** — Recursive functions (with efficiency warnings) and anonymous `lambda` functions for concise expressions.
- **Decorators and Documentation** — Documenting with docstrings; using decorators to modify function behavior without altering internal definitions.
